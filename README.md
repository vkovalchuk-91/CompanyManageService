# CompanyManageService
Restful service for managing employees and projects in which they are involved

RESTfull web service for internal company management. 
The service includes concepts of employees, teams and projects. 
The teams consist of managers and programmers of different levels (Jun/Mid/Senior) and types (developer, QA, DevOps). 
All of them can work on several projects at the same time. A relational database is used for data storage.

Implemented API for CRUD operations for employees, teams and projects. Implemented @ExceptionHandler. 30% of the code is covered by tests.
